    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In today&#39;s complex and fast-paced world, effectively identifying and addressing the root causes of problems
        is a crucial aspect of decision-making processes. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) has traditionally been a valuable
        tool in this regard. However, conventional RCA methods often fall short when dealing with multifaceted issues,
        leaving room for improved problem-solving approaches.</p>

    <p>A root cause analysis attempts to find the underlying cause of a problem, that if resolved would solve the
        problem or issue. It avoids immediately attempting to solve the problem and digs deeper.</p>
    <a class="marker" href="#section-3" id="section-3"><span>3</span></a>

    <h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
    <p>The underlying problem is the limitation of traditional RCA methods, such as the &quot;Five Whys&quot;, in
        addressing complex issues with multiple causes and diverse branching problems. These methods tend to
        oversimplify problems and often assume linear and singular causality, leading to incomplete understanding and
        ineffective solutions. This problem impacts a wide range of industries and sectors, affecting decision-makers
        who rely on RCA to solve critical issues.</p>

    <h3 id="the-five-whys">The problem with '5 Whys'</h3>
    <p>The five whys is a technique that asks the question “why” 5 or more times.</p>

    <p>Whilst the 5 Whys is easy to implement without supervision it has many cons <d-cite key="Card2016-mo"></d-cite><d-cite key="FiveWhys2007"></d-cite>
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>5 Whys may oversimplify complex problems by often only considering a single root cause</li>
        <li>Assumes linear causality: The 5 Whys method assumes that problems have linear and singular causes, whereas
            many issues may have multiple contributing factors and complex relationships between them, that may prevent
            one from reaching the final cause.</li>
        <li>Inadequate exploration of branching-related problems: The 5 Whys method does not inherently accommodate the
            exploration of branching questions that may arise from initial answers. As a result, critical aspects of the
            problem may remain hidden, as problems are skipped over, leading to an incomplete understanding of the issue
        </li>
        <li>The 5 Whys can often stop short of a comprehensive analysis, as stopping at the fifth &quot;why&quot; may
            not always reveal the true root cause. Even though you don’t need to stop at the fifth why, the naming of
            the method often constraints. Some problems may require more or fewer &quot;whys&quot; to reach the
            underlying cause (Dekker, S. (2006). The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error. CRC Press).</li>
        <li>Limitations due to simplistic questioning: The 5 Whys technique relies on asking the simple question
            &quot;why,&quot; which may not always be sufficient to explore complex problems. The technique may require
            clarification or additional probing questions to yield meaningful insights (Kepner, C. H., &amp; Tregoe, B.
            B. (1965). The rational manager: A systematic approach to problem solving and decision making. New York:
            McGraw-Hill).

    <h2 id="proposed-solution">Proposed solution</h2>
<p>This paper introduces the &quot;Many Whys&quot; approach, a evolutionary RCA method developed through consulting practices. This approach enhances the traditional &quot;Five Whys&quot; method by incorporating additional questions into the process.</p>
<p>The &quot;Many Whys&quot; approach allows for a more comprehensive exploration of problem branches and ensures clarity within the team. The process includes asking &quot;Why?&quot; to attempt to identify the root cause. However, the addition of additional questions uncovers potentially undiscovered answers, enabling multiple avenues of investigation. </p>
    <p>
        Evidence from the application of this approach suggests that it facilitates a more profound and broader understanding of problems, especially those with multiple causes. It also promotes team engagement and understanding, thus enhancing the overall effectiveness of the problem-solving process.

    <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>


        <h3 id="the-process">The process</h3>
        <p>1) Ask “why?” - General why</p>
        <p>2) Ask “why does {cause} create {effect}?” (a why chain) - to chain the whys in a cause an effect chain</p>
        <p>3) Ask “what else?” zero or more times - to branch the solution</p>
        <a class="marker" href="#section-4.1.1" id="section-4.1.1"><span>4.1.1</span></a>
        <p><strong>The why chain</strong> </p>




\begin{equation}Cause + Effect = \text{Why Question}\end{equation}


<p>
The why chain, directly links cause and effect together. It asks why was the cause created in reference to the previous cause.

e.g. Our code base keeps getting rewritten (Cp) → People keep leaving the team (C)

why does  “People leaving the team” cause “Our code base to keep getting rewritten”?</p>
